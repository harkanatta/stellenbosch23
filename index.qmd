##  [Kolgrafafj√∂r√∞ur]{.strokeme} {background-image="images/2.png" .slide-number:first-child}

::: {.notes}
This is the peaceful fjord Kolgrafafj√∂r√∞ur in Sn√¶fellsnes peninsula. I will just call it fjord for simplification
:::

##  {background-image="images/3.png"}

::: {.notes}
Iceland,
The fjord on this peninsula,
where the herring swam under the bridge that connects the landfill to the eastern side of the fjord,
the red area is where it covered the bottom,
yellow dots are the sampling stations,
there is limited water exchange in the fjord, so the herring finished up all the oxygen just by being there.
:::

##  {background-image="images/6b.png"}
...we went sampling

![](images/VogJOR.jpg){.fragment .r-stretch}


::: {.notes}
This is the first sampling trip in june, 4 months after.Stations were from a former reserch in 1999.
Some of you already know where this is heading...

::: {.notes}
I spent the winter sorting species and the project sparked further interest.
:::

##  The Impact of the Herring Crisis: 

Fjord Closure Debates and Research Opportunities

::: {.notes}
the project sparked further interest,
People were were furious over lost revenue, they wanted to close the fjord so the herring might never escape there again.
Money was allocated to clean-up and also research so the project continued.

##  Main goals reevaluated

::: {.notes}
At first our aim was to investigate the immediate impacts of a catastrophe in 2013.
But as the project sparked more interest we sought out the funding to examine it decently.
There had been a mass mortality of herring in Norway in the nineties the succession was documented there by Eivind Oug and colleagues.
Gu√∞mundur V√≠√∞ir guided me in the masters project

<div class="control-diet" data-id="trt1">Examine **species composition** and **succession** of macrofauna from 2013 to 2017</div>
<div class="sugar-diet" data-id="trt2"> Document the **eventual return to equilibrium** in the fjord</div>

GV left one year because he thought it would be more sensible to see the final year.
So I was asked to do the 2016 sorting....

![](images/alltlika2016.png)

::: {.notes}
I was lucky that my boss was on a leave for an indefinate amount of time when I took on this project. Because I didn't realize how much time Gu√∞mundur V√≠√∞ir had saved me. I could bring all the difficult worms to him and he would either show me what it was and how to identify them or he would say don't bother with this one one, it is jus a syllid ;)
Anyway the sorting took me more than two years on and off.

As a reminder, we had these regular stations that we sampled every year. This dendrogram is designed to illustrate the hierarchical relationship among the various species detected at these stations, allowing us to identify clusters and patterns of similarity based on the ecological data collected.

This dendogram show how all the 2013 stations and most of the 2014 stations stand out in the bottom

![](images/worrms.png)

- I used the R package 'worms' to aid in the verification of species names.
- Outdated or misspelled names were plentyful.
- 'worms' can also provide the taxonomic hierarchy for each species.
